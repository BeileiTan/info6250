        In part to head off more stringent laws, companies and computer scientists are collaborating to provide
        computational and business solutions to strengthen data protections while not hampering innovation and
        operational efficiency. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others have come forward with changes that give
        users more control over how they are being tracked and how their data is being used. “Privacy is personal, which
        makes it even more vital for companies to give people clear, individual choices around how their data is used,”
        wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a May 2019 opinion piece for The New York Times.

        Some recent changes include the following: Google users can now choose to opt in to save their audio data
        collected by Google Assistant, which uses it to better recognize their voices over time. They can also delete
        their
        interactions at any time and agree to a human reviewer of the audio. This month, Facebook’s Instagram rolled out
        a new feature that lets users manage which third-party apps have access to their data. In September, Facebook
        said
        it has suspended tens of thousands of sketchy apps from 400 developers. Amazon also is cracking down on
        third-party
        apps for breaking its privacy rules while Apple said it will no longer retain audio recordings that Siri
        collects by default, among other things.
